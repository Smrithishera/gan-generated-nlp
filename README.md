Text Generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
This module implements a simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for text generation. The project includes the following key components:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
data_loader.py: 
Contains functions to load and preprocess text data, converting it into sequences suitable for training the GAN.

Model Building:
models.py: Defines the architecture of the generator and discriminator models, as well as the combined GAN model.

Training:
training.py: Includes the training loop for the GAN, where the generator tries to produce realistic text sequences and the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated sequences.

Text Generation:
generate_text.py: Contains functions to generate text sequences using the trained generator model.

Main Script:
main.py: The main entry point of the project, which orchestrates the data loading, model building, training, and text generation processes.
This project provides a foundational framework for experimenting with GANs in the context of text generation, showcasing the potential of generative models in natural language processing tasks.
